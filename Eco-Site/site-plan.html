They are people who care about environmental issues but feel overwhelmed by complicated solutions and expensive eco-products. They value practical, tested advice and are looking for cost-effective ways to make a positive environmental impact.</p>

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Montserrat
      </h4>
      <p>
        This clean, modern font provides excellent readability while maintaining a professional appearance.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans
      </h4>
      <p>
        Open Sans is highly readable and works well for longer content. It pairs nicely with Montserrat and maintains the clean, which is exactly what i want for the site.

        The best way to get started with sustainable living is to focus on small, achievable changes. Start with simple actions like reducing single-use plastics, turning off lights when leaving a room, or starting a basic composting system.

        Living sustainably doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. Many eco-friendly choices, like using a reusable water bottle or shopping with cloth bags, can actually save you money while helping the environment.
